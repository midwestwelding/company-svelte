    <p class="py-2">Operating at 60,000 PSI, moving in 2 computer-controlled directions, on a cutting surface that is 6’ X 12’, our waterjet is able to cut material of a very wide range of types and thicknesses with water and garnet. We have experience with very thin rubbers, plywood, plexiglass, UHMW, Aluminum, Steel, Marble and Granite. This method is superior to laser and plasma because it can cut materials that would otherwise melt or burn, like rubber, plastics and wood.</p>
    <p class="py-2">The waterjet’s application is perfectly suited for prototypes, part replacements, templates, blanks, signs and bulk part orders. Contact us today to find out how we can serve you!</p>
